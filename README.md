# Personal-Website

My portfolio website I made from scratch where I spent too much time centering a div. Here, you can find my professional experiences and skills. I plan to add much more to it in terms of a page for teaching materials, a blog for photography and an additional blog for all the projects I pursue regarding my personal hobbies. You'll learn a lot more about me by seeing it for yourself, so check it out here:
